# Work in Progress

Attempting to write a class that enforces a strict 1:1 relationship between objects when appropriate. 

Example: In a specific context, we know 4 will always be associated with "Four" and "Four" will always be associated with 4. Instead of creating two seperate maps that might not be synced or enforce strict 1:1 relationships, wrap it all in a class and do it ourselves.
